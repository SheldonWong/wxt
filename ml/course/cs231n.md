- cifar-10 32*32*3 10
- Since we defined the score of each class as a weighted sum of all image pixels, each class score is a linear function over this space.
- 我们定义每个类别的分数，就是这一行权重向量*像素向量
- As we saw above, every row of W is a classifier for one of the classes
- W的每一行就是一种图片的分类器
- Another interpretation for the weights W is that each row of W corresponds to a template (or sometimes also called a prototype) for one of the classes. The score of each class for an image is then obtained by comparing each template with the image using an inner product (or dot product) one by one to find the one that “fits” best. 
- 对权重W的另一种解释是W的每一行对应于一个类的模板（或有时也称为原型）。 然后通过逐个地使用内积（或点积）将每个模板与图像进行比较来获得图像的每个类的得分，以找到“最适合”的那个。
